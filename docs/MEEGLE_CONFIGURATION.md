# Meegle Project Configuration Guide

Since the Meegle API does not allow plugins to programmatically create Work Item Types or Fields, you need to manually configure your project to match the TrumpSword system.

Please follow this guide to set up your Meegle project.

## 1. Work Item Types (工作项类型)

Please ensure the following 4 types exist in your project. You can rename existing types or create new ones.

| Internal Type | **Meegle Type Name** (Recommended) | **Type Key** (Crucial) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Legislative | **Bill** | `bill` | For Acts, Bills, Resolutions |
| Executive | **Executive Orders** | `executive_orders` | For Executive Orders, Memorandums |
| Appointment | **Oops** | `oops` | For Appointments, Issues, Alerts |
| Social | **Social Media** | `social_media` | For Truth Social & X Posts |

> **Note**: The "Type Key" is usually generated by Meegle (e.g., `story_720...`). TrumpSword will automatically find the type by its **Name** ("Bill", "Executive Orders", "Oops", "Social Media"), so the Name is the most important part.

## 2. Custom Fields (字段配置)

For **ALL** types above, please add the following custom fields.


| Field Name (Label) | Field Type | Key Identifier (System) | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trump said that** | Text (Single Line) | `field_trump_said` | Stores the Event Title / Quote |
| **We need to** | Text (Single Line) | `field_we_need_to` | Action Item Title |
| **Which means** | Text (Multi-line / Rich Text) | `field_which_means` | AI Analysis / Summary |
| **It should started at** | Date / Time | `field_start_date` | Event Occurrence Date |
| **Tag** | Multi-select / Tag | `field_tag` | e.g. "Make America Great Again" |
| **Source Link** | Link / Text | `field_link` | Original URL (Whitehouse.gov etc) |

> **Tip**: You can create these fields once in the "Field Library" (字段库) and reuse them across all 3 types.

## 4. Verification
Once configured:

3.  Check your Meegle Project. You should see new items created under "Bill", "Executive Orders", and "Oops" with all fields correctly filled!
